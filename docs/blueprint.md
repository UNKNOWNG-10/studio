## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant HSL color like purple (#713FC2) to reflect modernity and financial tech.
- Background color: Use a light, desaturated version of the primary color (#F1EEF8) to maintain a clean interface.
- Accent color: Choose an analogous HSL color, in this case dark blue (#3F51B5), to complement the purple and draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist icons related to earning, staking, and referral rewards.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for Home, Leaderboard, Friends, and Tasks.
- Subtle transitions and animations for user interactions, like staking confirmation.
